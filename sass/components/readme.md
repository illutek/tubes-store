###Components: 
A component should be a responsive, reusable element that can be placed anywhere on your site. 
This means it will not have any predefined size and it will not care which page region it is placed in. 
When this type of configuration is required, you should be using additional layout classes that can be 
added to a component as needed. Note: If you read more into SMACSS, you will notice this category is 
actually called modules. In the context of Drupal, we use component to avoid confusion with core or 
contrib modules.
