###Theme: 
Commonly described as visual styling for a component. However, I prefer to think of it as style overrides 
because your component will have visual styling as well. The theme category comes into play when a 
single theme needs an alternate visual style -- like a colour scheme. This folder could contain 
additional files like dark.css or red.css that will apply styles that override what was previously 
defined in the component.
